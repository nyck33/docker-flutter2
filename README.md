Flutter Fastlane Android Docker Images
===

**note: these are not in any way official!**

### Note: I tried to fork https://github.com/matsp/docker-flutter but fell behind so just pushed my cloned local copy here
### So most of the code is from that repo and folder flutter25 is what I wrote based on what I learned from the other folder's Docker files.
### if you just want the image, see here: https://hub.docker.com/r/nyck33/myimage2

Docker images based on `cimg/android:<version>` with Flutter and Fastlane pre-installed.
